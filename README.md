# Laravel init project
I created a boilerplate for laravel project, you can easily init the laravel 8 projects with some basic configurations like role & permission, API JWT authentication, and swagger API doc.

use this for init project and save time.

##setup project command
composer install

npm install

cp .env.example .env

php artisan key:generate

php artisan migrate

php artisan db:seed

php artisan serve
